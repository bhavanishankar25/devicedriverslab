#this will create lab6_char.ko file

# create a device node in kernel device tree. Following is the command to create the device node
# "mknod path type major minor"
# path:- path is the place where device file needs to be created . Mostly we create our device file under /dev directory. we give same name of device file which we registered at the time registering our driver. As in above code wehad given device name is “mydev”. So we will give path as /dev/mydev.
# type:- type will be “c” or “b” . Weather our device will be registered as character device or block device.
# major :- Major number of driver. In our case we assumed device major number as 90.
# minor:- minor number is defined as minor number of device. we are assuming this value to 1.

mknod /dev/custom_device  c 11 1 #making node for my devce driver

chmod a+r+w /dev/custom_device #giving permisions

echo "custom_device_driver" > /dev/custom_device # passing data to the device

sudo rmmod simple_char_drv # for remove the module from the list 

lsmod # to check if the module is cleared or not
